# Performance Tuning Guide

!!! warning "Under Development"
    This document is being written and content will be continuously updated.

This guide will teach you how to optimize Genesis model training performance, including memory usage, computational efficiency, and I/O optimization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Goals

- **Training Speed**: Increase samples processed per second
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduce GPU memory usage
- **Throughput**: Maximize hardware utilization

## ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis Tools

### Built-in Profiler

```python
import genesis.utils.profile as profiler

# WIP: Performance analysis code example
with profiler.profile() as prof:
    # Training code
    pass

prof.print_stats()
```

## âš¡ Optimization Strategies

### 1. Memory Optimization

- Gradient accumulation
- Checkpoint techniques
- Mixed precision training

### 2. Compute Optimization

- Operator fusion
- Triton kernel optimization
- CUDA stream overlap

### 3. I/O Optimization

- Data prefetching
- Multi-process data loading
- Memory mapping

## ðŸ“ˆ Benchmarking

- Performance comparison with PyTorch
- Performance testing with different configurations
- Bottleneck identification methods
