# Custom Operator Development

!!! warning "Under Development"
    This document is being written and content will be continuously updated.

The Genesis framework supports custom operator development, allowing you to implement specialized neural network operations. This tutorial will teach you how to create high-performance custom operators from scratch.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand Genesis operator system architecture
- Learn to implement CPU and GPU versions of custom operators
- Master Triton kernel programming techniques
- Learn operator optimization and performance debugging methods

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure you have:
- Completed the [Basic Training Tutorial](basic-training.md)
- Understanding of CUDA programming basics
- Familiarity with Python C extension development

## 🛠️ Development Environment

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install triton pybind11 cmake ninja
```

## 📝 Example: RMSNorm Operator

We will implement RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Normalization) as an example.

### CPU Implementation

```python
# WIP: CPU implementation code will be added in future versions
```

### GPU Implementation (Triton)

```python  
# WIP: Triton implementation code will be added in future versions
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features

- Automatic differentiation support
- Memory optimization techniques
- Operator fusion strategies
